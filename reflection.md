This is the second iteration of my original chords project.  Now the goal is to use a loop to play two external audio files on a timed loop.  This will allow me to begin to program little songs that repeat themselves.  I am learning how loops work in the context of p5.sound.  They rely on beats, tempo, phrases, and parts.  These will allow me to slowly stack MIDI notes and audio samples so I can build these loops.
